#MD-Environ

This is an extension to [Python-Markdown](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/)
which allows environment variables to be inserted into the text. I
originally wrote it for my [FORD](https://github.com/cmacmackin/ford)
Fortran auto-documentation generator. 


##Installation
This module can now be installed using ``pip``.

    pip install md-environ


##Usage
This module can be used in a program in the following way:

```python
import markdown
html = markdown.markdown(source, extensions=['md_environ.environ'])
```

The syntax for use within your Markdown files is
``${ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE}``. This statement will be replaced by the
contents of ``ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE``, if it is defined, or by an empty
string otherwise.

##ChangeLog
###Version 0.1
Initial release.
